## How does it work?

AutoPWN Suite uses nmap TCP-SYN scan to enumerate the host and detect the version of softwares running on it. After gathering enough information about the host, AutoPWN Suite automatically generates a list of "keywords" to search [NIST vulnerability database](https://www.nist.gov/).


### Sample output

AutoPWN Suite has a very user friendly easy to read output.
